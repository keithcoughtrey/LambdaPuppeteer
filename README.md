# Lambda-puppeteer HTML to PDF

This project contains sample code related to a series of Medium articles.

In the [first article](https://itnext.io/html-to-pdf-using-a-chrome-puppet-in-the-cloud-de6e6a0dc6d7?sk=de0cbdf69ae1cfd52ecd8ba457c2ded7) of the series, I walked through the process of setting up a headless chrome browser that you can run on AWS and using the Puppeteer API, have chrome navigate to a URL, wait for the page to fully-load and then create a PDF.
